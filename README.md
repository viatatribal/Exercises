# Exercises

This is a collection of random codes used either to learn something or to solve random problems. The objective is both to exercise my problem-solving skills and to learn new stuffs without being a side/main project. Just like an artist uses a sketchbook to train drawing skills, I'm using this to train problem-solving skills. Most, if not all, of the code here is useless to anyone but myself.
